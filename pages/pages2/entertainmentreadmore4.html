    <h3>‘Record Labels Are Neither Toxic Enclaves Nor Torture Chambers For Artistes’
    </h3>
    <img src="../../assets/images/entertainment images/image4.jpg" alt="adesuwa" width="800px" height="700px">
    <p>There are strong indications that the death of fast rising rapper<br>singer and songwriter Ilerioluwa Oladimeji
      Aloba,<br> professionally known as MohBad, in controversial circumstances<br> may mark a turning point in the
      Nigerian<br> music industry with respect to artiste-record label relationships.<br>

      Amid protests by his fans, the Police have launched investigations<br> to unravel the true cause of Mohbad’s
      death,<br> which involved the exhumation of his body and the conduct of an autopsy last Thursday.</p>

    <p>But stakeholders have expressed the belief that with developments following the singer’s death, <br>the industry,
      which is one of the fastest-growing creative industries in the world,<br> currently estimated to worth $19 billion
      in valuation <br>and generating over $2 billion (N1.5trillion) in revenue per year as of 2021,<br> may witness a
      system rebirth that would ensure that artistes <br>and record labels sign agreements that are mutually beneficial.<br>

      Already, the National Assembly has disclosed that it is working on establishing<br> a commission that will be saddled
      with the resolution <br>of disputes between record labels and their signees.<br>

      The Chairman, <br>Senate Committee on Creative Economy and senator representing <br>Adamawa North Senatorial District,
      Ishaku Abbo, <br>who made the disclosure when he paid a condolence visit to the residence of Mrs Adebose
      Olumuyi,<br> the mother of late Mohbad, had said the Senate,<br> in collaboration with the Ministry of Art,<br>
      Culture, and Creative Economy, will see to the creation of the commission.</p>
    <p> He said:“I have received petitions from Nigerians calling for either a creative economy or entertainment economy<br>
      commission where disputes that arise between record labels<br> and their signees would be settled.<br> When we
      have this commission, <br>nobody will start taking things into their own hands. But this doesn’t exist now in this<br>
      country and I am assuring you that the Senate of the 10th assembly,<br> in collaboration with the minister for
      creative economy,<br> will come up with a commission called creative economy commission.”

      <br> Signed to Marlian Records, Mohbad, 27, died on September 12, 2023.<br> However, he had left the record label
      in 2022,<br> citing unpaid royalties from 2019. He accused the record label of refusing to pay him his royalties<br>
      from monetised intellectual content and advances as mutually<br> agreed in their contractual agreement.

      <br>The announcement of his exit from the record label was contained in a statement released on October 25,
      2022,<br> by his management and legal team, which explained that the late KPK (Ko Por Ke) crooner’s exit<br> was as a
      result of the constant attacks he received,<br> which were allegedly orchestrated by Naira Marley following his demand
      for unpaid royalties and change of his manager,<br> who incidentally is Marley’s brother.

      <br> “In contravention of the terms of the arrangement between our client and yourself,
    </p>
    <p>you have failed to pay any advances as mutually agreed by both parties since 2019 till date. <br>You have also
      failed to pay all royalties due our client from all his intellectual property works monetised,<br> released and
      utilised by you from 2019 till date,” the document read.<br>

      On October 5, 2022, Mohbad had through his Twitter handle revealed bloodied bodies,<br> claiming that it was as a
      result of being assaulted by the Marlian crew,<br> because he requested to have his manager changed.<br>

      “Just because I want to change my manager who is their brother,<br> see what they did to me at Marlian House.<br>
      World pls help me oo, I’m dying inside,” he had tweeted.<br>

      MohBad had also accused Naira Marley of being present during the assault and doing nothing to stop it. <br>His
      eventual death in unclear circumstances has,<br> however, triggered a demand for fair treatment of artistes by their
      record labels even as artistes are also <br>advised to do due diligence before entering into an agreement.

      <br>Rapper Fasasi Mobolaji Gaius, popularly known as Da Emperor in entertainment quarters,
    </p>
    <p>told The Guardian that like Mohbad, many artistes were facing<br> exploitation and humiliation by their record labels
      but can’t speak up or quit.<br>

      The Da Emperor, who is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Etiemelo Empire Entertainment, said:<br> “For Mohbad’s
      incident, we all saw videos of multiple harassment and pronounced hatred<br> on him which went viral after his demise.<br>
      He also talked about his struggle and pains via his music, <br>even though many didn’t pay actual attention to these
      details. <br>Although we weren’t close, so many artistes have been in a similar state or are currently in such a
      state.<br> I remember Pelepele, who was also an indigenous rapper and someone who I appreciated and vice versa;<br> he
      spilled out a lot on his songs but people didn’t pay attention to the details.<br>

      “In fact, he titled his last project His Last Stanza; <br>he talked about his last moment in detail, and how it<br>
      was going to happen before he later passed on.

      “I also know that every industry has its own challenges from favouritism,<br> eye service, godfatherism, <br>terms and
      conditions and so on.</p>
    <p>Like the popular saying, the dream is free, the hustle is sold separately.<br>

      “I am not one to judge a book by its cover; there has been speculation from left to right.</p>
    <p>So, until whoever is proven guilty, the right thing is to let the law take its course.<br> I just hope it doesn’t
      go like the majority of most Nigerian cases/issues, <br>which are mostly propaganda till they fade out.<br> It’s
      saddening that his light which just began to shine very bright had to be cut, <br>but then God knows best.”

      <br>He noted that most artistes sign contracts without knowing what they actually signed, <br>explaining that
      industry professionals always emphasise on the need to review every contract<br> with an entertainment lawyer
      before signing.<br>

      “Yes, I know that most deals come to artistes that have very promising futures<br> or are doing well with music by
      themselves before the deal comes through to make the load lighter for them.<br> So, most times it’s always a case
      of ‘omo make them help me carry the entire burden, <br>my neck don dey pain me tey tey’.

      <br>“However, if we must be truly realistic, nothing is free even in Freetown.
    </p>
    <p>Anyone who spends a lot on an artiste is expecting to make a profit off such artiste <br>(whether he/she claims
      it’s a form of help, business is business). <br>Artistes should always have this at the back of their mind,”
      <br>Da Emperor further explained.

      He stated that by his experience,<br> most deals always come as a matter of how bad the artiste wants it,<br>
      adding: “As for me, I have turned down deals that didn’t go with my aura.<br> Overtime, I floated my own record
      label/company, Etiemelo Empire Entertainment.<br> I haven’t for once signed any artiste but I have supported so
      many artistes to the little of my capacity.<br>

      “Don’t get it twisted; I do not expect others to be like myself because we all have different perspectives to
      life,<br>people, business, money and beliefs.<br></p>
    <p>I have gotten calls on making sure whoever I support signs a contract, <br>but I turned deaf ears and just do my
      things as the spirit leads.<br>

      “I have noticed for a long while that most record companies owned by a known artiste in Nigeria,<br> always have
      challenges when it comes to signing other artistes overtime.<br></p>
    <p>I feel this is so sometimes because funds can get funny and won’t be enough to cater for the needs of the
      artiste/artistes.<br> Secondly, there can’t be two captains navigating a ship.

      <br>“Finally, when artistes sign a contract, for instance five years, <br>and their ‘blow span’ is probably one
      year or two,<br> they exhaust their span under their label and afterwards it feels like nothing is happening
      anymore.<br>
      “For some other artistes, they don’t make much money back for the label<br>until their contract tenure is over.
    </p>
    <p>The label wants a renewal (so they can recoup their profit/ interest)<br> while the artiste wants out because the
      contract is over. <br>This can lead to a long time rivalry or fracas. <br>In some other cases, the artiste didn’t
      take time to read the contract thoroughly and wants to or even leaves before the end of the contract, <br>this is
      another scenario that gets brutal.”

      On whether artistes are forced to do certain thing(s)<br> against their conscience or belief like joining a cult
      or swearing an oath by their record labels as being insinuated in the case of MohBad,<br> the recording
      artiste/label chief said: “I do not know. However, there is every possibility of such things happening.<br> Every
      organisation has its terms and conditions.<br> Whether boldly spelt or written in tiny fonts, there is always
      something that sets aside organisation A from B.<br>

      “Some of these are coined from past experiences or from their religious or street oriented beliefs.<br></p>
    <p>All in all, we as individuals should just try to be more observant and careful.”<br>

      According to him, challenges for artistes/labels can come in diverse forms,<br> ranging from irregularities to
      change in contract terms,<br> lack of funds, good paying shows and hit songs, among others.

      For the CEO of Now Muzik,<br> Efe Omorogbe, the news of Mohbad’s death was heartbreaking. </p>
    <p>Commenting on artistes signing recording/management deals without knowing the details of what they signed,<br>
      the co-founder, Hypertek Digital/960 Music Group and founder Buckwyld Media Network,<br> a creative and production
      solution outfit, said: <br>“It’s usually down to lack of music business education and maybe desperation in some
      instances.<br> The standard practice is that a draft contract is given to the artiste for review before signing.

      <br>“Artistes are expected to engage knowledgeable lawyers to assist with negotiating the terms and reviewing the
      draft.
    </p>
    <p>It is called a draft because until the artiste’s legal representatives make their input and insist on the
      necessary edits,<br> the agreement cannot be signed.”

      On whether upcoming artistes<br> are forced to do certain thing(s)<br> that are against their conscience or
      belief,<br> the entertainment chieftain stated: “I don’t have the facts of the matter yet and investigations are
      ongoing. <br>I however think there are isolated situations and sweeping generalisations may be misleading.

      “For artistes to be<br> ‘forced to join a cult or swear an oath’ presupposes that most of the label owners are
      cult members which is definitely not the case.<br> There have been more cases where disputes between artistes and
      labels end up in a court of law <br>or in a media duel that forces respected individuals to wade in as unofficial
      arbiters than those that have led to physical assault,<br> gang wars and stuff like that .

      “It’s unfortunate; <br>but these situations should not be allowed to paint the labels as toxic enclaves or torture
      chambers for artistes.<br> Nothing can be farther from the truth.

      “Artistes face the challenges of advancing their <br>careers with limited budgets and stiff competition.<br>
      Artistes face the challenges of getting a hit record, staying relevant, visible and bankable.<br> Through all of
      these, the key ally and support structure is usually the label/management. <br>I dare say that more than family,
      friends and fans, the key support base for the artiste in a regular scenario is the label/management.<br>

      “They support with investment, strategy, personnel and other essential resources.</p>
    <p> A few unwholesome situations do not render the label the enemy; <br>80 percent of stars out there would not have
      a career without the labels and a good number of labels are founded or co-owned by artistes.<br> It would be
      helpful to put situations in the right context.”

      Checks by The Guardian showed that break up between artistes<br>and their record label/management is not new in
      the country.<br> It was gathered that many artistes are blinded by the juiciness of the contract offer and fail to
      do due diligence before signing<br> the offer while many underdog artistes would embrace anything as long as it
      would help them realise their dreams. <br>This explains why artistes enter into contracts which their fans see as
      slavery and the rising cases of contractual<br> disputes between artistes and record labels.

      <br>The Runtown versus EricMany fight is a good example of<br> failure to fulfill contractual obligations.
    </p>
    <p>EricMany had gotten a court injunction in Nigeria against the singer and interestingly<br> from another court of
      law in the U.S. <br>– a place he has been banned from going to. Notwithstanding the injunctions, <br>Runtown
      performed in the U.S. At the end of the legal debacle EricMany won.

      <br>There is also the case of Brymo versus Chocolate City. Brymo called out the founder of the label, <br>Audu
      Maikori, who incidentally is a lawyer first, then an entrepreneur with perfect understanding of the music
      industry<br> on Twitter.

      Brymo’s action was considered a bad move clearly spurred by negative advice.
    </p>

    <p>Chocolate City got an injunction to claim every of his recordings. <br>The case dragged and dragged and Brymo
      couldn’t put out any material until he lost the fan base he had built overtime.<br>

      After being let off the hook, the singer came out to say the judge didn’t make any judgment.<br> It needs to be
      noted that while other artistes on the label were making money, <br>Brymo was fighting an injunction.

      Many might not be aware of the Jaywon vs Kennis Music<br> conflict because Jaywon wasn’t quite good with social
      media and it was an in-house battle.<br> Without the expiration of his contract, Jaywon wanted a
      renegotiation,<br> forgetting the directors of Kennis Music are industry veterans.<br> They served all
      broadcasting stations a letter stopping them from playing any of<br> Jaywon’s materials which is akin to putting a
      stop to his career.

      <br>Jaywon was asked to go and beg the head of the label.<br> He survived, but till date he has been unable to
      promote any of his new material<br> in the manner he got promoted while at Kennis Music.

      <br>There was also the Vector versus YSG.
    </p>
    <p>The rapper was at some point featuring Movado on a song and shooting its video<br> in New York but got into a
      rift with YSG, his record label.<br>

      Upon his confirmation that he was stuck with the label till 2017<br>, he began to throw jabs at them in records
      till they got an injunction refraining him from performing,<br>recording and appearing at public events.<br> He
      was caged alongside his talent and forced to render a public apology. <br>Although he got off the hook, <br>the
      music industry had left him behind.
