        <h3>Troops rescue kidnapped victim in Enugu</h3>
        <img src="../../assets/images/entertainment images/image6.webp" alt="adesuwa" width="1000px" height="1000px">
        <p>The troops of 103 Battalion (Rear) of 82 Division, Nigerian Army, presently on Operation UDO KA II had<br>
            rescued Dr Maxwell Ayim between Four Corner-Agbogwe Junction in Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State.
        </p>
        <p>This was contained in a statement issued in Enugu on Saturday by Lt.-Col.<br> Jonah Unuakhalu, acting Deputy
            Director Army Public Relations,<br> 82 Division, Nigerian Army.

            Unuakhalu said that Ayim was rescued unhurt on Thursday.<br>

            According to him, the rescue operation was conducted when troops deployed at Udi checkpoint received a
            <br>distress call from the police on the incident.

            Unuakhalu said that on arrival, the troops came in contact with the kidnappers,<br> adding that due to the
            troops’ superior fire,<br> members of the criminal gang fled in disarray with gunshot wounds into the nearby
            bushes.
        </p>
        <p> The army spokesman said that the gallant troops during further exploitation of the gang withdrawal route<br>
            found the victim abandoned by the gang.<br>

            “Troops proceeded to rescue the victim. He had since been reunited with his family after preliminary medical
            checks.<br>

            “Joint Task Force Operation UDO KA II therefore, calls on the law abiding and good citizens of Enugu and the<br>
            South-East region in general not to relent in providing timely, credible and reliable Information.<br>

            “This will help in putting an end to the spiral of kidnapping activities and sundry criminality within the<br>
            region.

            “Operation UDO KA II will continue combating crime and criminality in accordance with the extant rules and<br>
            regulations guiding its operations,” he said.
