        <h3>Iyabo Ojo urges Nigerians to be patient for Mohbad's autopsy results</h3>
        <img src="../../assets/images/entertainment images/image5.webp" alt="adesuwa" width="1000px" height="1000px">
        <p>Nollywood actress Iyabo Ojo has beckoned on Nigerians to be patient in their wait for the result of Mohbad's
            recently concluded autopsy.<br>The public figure took to her Instagram Live to remind Nigerians to focus on
            the main agenda, which is attaining justice for the late singer <em color:red;>Ilerioluwa Oladimeji
                Aloba,</em> aka Mohbad.<br> She stressed that the Nigeria police have requested for two weeks for the
            release of the autopsy results, <br>after which she urged people to be patient until then.</p>
        <p> She said, "Everybody's eyes are on this case, they said we should give them two weeks, <br>I know that some
            of those results may not be out then but they asked for two weeks,<br> and they are on it. We need to be
            patient and wait for them.<br> What is important is that we should wait for the autopsy results to come out
            and for the police to come and address us. <br>Let us stop with the distractions, it won't stop us from
            getting justice, we will get justice.<br> Please let the police do their job. If the suspects don't come in
            for questioning,<br> the police would do what they have to do."
